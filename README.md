### Hi there, my name is Volker and I am just playing around ðŸ‘‹

I am a spare time developer and learning new thinks day by day. I have worked with HTML, CSS, SASS and JAVASCRIPT/TypeScript.
I have written 3 extensions for VS Code, which are available in the marketplace and also here at github.

- **insernums** inserts sequences of numbers or chars to a text file. This extension is very flexible and base on this sublimetext extention from James Books (https://github.com/jbrooksuk/InsertNums).
- **gessQ** helps when writing online questionnaires with gessQ. Software by (https://www.gessgroup.de).
- **gessTabs** helps tabulating surveys with gessTabs by (https://www.gessgroup.de)
